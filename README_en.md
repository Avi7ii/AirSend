<h2 align="center">📖 Do you feel the same way?</h2>

You love the smooth UI and productivity of Mac, but you carry a powerful and free Android phone in your pocket.

Whenever you want to transfer photos or instantly sync verification codes and links to your Mac clipboard, that "ecosystem wall" stands in your way:
*   **AirDrop**? That's an internal party for Apple users; Android can only watch from the outside.
*   **WeChat/QQ File Helper**? For just a few bytes, you have to endure data usage, privacy scans, and tedious logins.
*   **Official LocalSend**? While it solves connectivity, as a cross-platform (Flutter) product, it feels sluggish and bulky on Mac, even the window corners don't match the system.

**Until AirSend.**

<h2 align="center">🔥 AirSend: Break Borders, Return to Instinct</h2>

`AirSend` is a "system-level enhancement" that bridges the ecosystem gap. We believe: **Great tools should not fight for the user's attention.**

### 1. Zero UI Design: Not a single extra window
AirSend completely discards tedious main interfaces. All its vitality is condensed into a tiny icon in the macOS menu bar. 
No complex menus, no heavy panels. It's light as air:
*   **Drag & Send**: Just drop files onto the menu bar icon, and the handshake completes automatically.
*   **Silent Watch**: It only pops up an elegant micro-animation at the moment of transfer.

### 2. Clipboard Cloud Sync: Give Android a "Universal Clipboard"
This is AirSend's hidden killer feature. Based on a deep customization of the LocalSend protocol, it achieves **automatic cross-platform clipboard synchronization**.
When you copy text on your phone, the Mac clipboard is instantly updated. No action required; it's like sharing one brain.
